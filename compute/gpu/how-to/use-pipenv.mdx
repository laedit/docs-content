<Message type="note">

  Prior to [TODO DATE], Scaleway GPU Instances were pre-installed with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) for managing python dependencies and virtual environments with Python. From [TO DO DATE], Pipenv will replace Anaconda on our Docker images.

</Message>

Pipenv is a package and dependency manager for Python projects. It harnesses Pip, Pipfile and and virtualenv in one tool. With Pipenv, you can create a separate virtual environment for each of your projects, and automatically install and manage dependencies within each of them. 

Pipenv is pre-installed on all of Scaleway's AI Docker images for GPU Instances. A number of useful AI core packages and tools are also installed, including scipy, numpy, scikit-learn, jupyter, tensorflow and the Scakewat SDK. Depending on the container image you choose, other packages and tools will also be pre-installed, providing a convenient framework environment for you so that you can begin work immediately. For the full list of Scaleway's AI Docker images and their pre-installations, see [TODO INSERT LINK].

Regardless of your Docker image, you will be able to use Pipenv to install new packages and manage their versions across multiple different virtual environments if necessary.
