<Message type="note">

  Prior to [TODO DATE], Scaleway GPU Instances were pre-installed with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) for managing python dependencies and virtual environments with Python. From [TO DO DATE], Pipenv will replace the Anaconda on our Docker images.

</Message>

Pipenv is a package and dependency manager for Python projects. With Pipenv, you can create a separate virtual environment for each of your projects, and automatically install and manage dependencies within each of them. Pip, Pipfile and and virtualenv are harnessed in one tool, making it easy for users and developers to set up one or many different working environments.

Pipenv is pre-installed on all of our AI Docker images for GPU Instances. A number of useful AI core packages and tools are also installed, including scipy, numpy, scikit-learn, jupyter, tensorflow and the Scakewat SDK, among many others. For the full list of pre-installed packages, see [TODO INSERT LINK].

You will be able to use Pipenv to install new packages, and manage their versions across multiple different virtual environments if necessary.
